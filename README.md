# Additional-Foods
This is a Minecraft mod that adds a lot of foods

## Description
Today, the Fabric version of Farmer's Delight is deprecated, 
and I decide to recreate many of their things. 
I haven't recreated everything, but...
Enjoy this little Minecraft mod with your friends or others.
If you find a bug, you can open an issue, and I'll try to fix it.
By the way, feel free to give me suggestions for things you would like to see added!
